					"description" : "When Kurt Wallander first appeared, he was a senior police officer, his life in a mess. His wife had left him, his father barely acknowledged him; he ate badly and drank alone at night. The Pyramid chronicles the events that led him to such a place. We see him in the early years, doing hours on the beat; witness the beginnings of his fragile relationship with Mona; and learn the reason behind his difficulties with his father. These thrilling tales provide a fascinating insight into Wallander's character. From the stabbing of a neighbour in 1969 to a light aircraft accident in 1989, every story is a vital piece of the Wallander series, showing Mankell at the top of his game.",

He has two obsessions: the tango and a conviction that someone is after him. He has no close friends, no close neighbours, and by the time his body is found, Molin is almost unrecognizable. Stefan Lindman, a police officer on extended sick leave, hears of the death of his former colleague and decides to involve himself in the case. What he discovers, to his horror and disbelief, is a network of evil almost unimaginable in this remote district, and one which seems impossible to link to Molin's death.",
